declare using of mimalloc in Faithful/README.md

cmake rpath, visibility (CMP0063), Position-Independent Code (PIC) are "disabled"
 ---> __currently__ we don't use shared libraries (will we use them in future?)

ask user to install libasound (if not yet)

specify rpath, visibility for libasound (ALSA) ((or other audio backend))


OpenAL usage: need to use al.h NOT <AL/al.h> <--- from CMake find_package(OpenAL)
