/* So we have:
* menu: new game, load game, settings, help, about, resources/data, quit
*   // menu changes depends on player progress as well as content of
    *resources/data There are 6 parts of game (Gothic-like), where territory may be
*      generally the same but with some differences:
*      Part I:
*        like Spring-month, friendly atmosphere, all around is "green-live",
*relatively small area Part II: all seems to be the same + new territory, where
*player can find new friends/enemies, collaborations Part III: start of Big
*Game showed all HUGE area; main part of game something bad happened, so now
*everything is not the same but being degradated: not-green, liquids starting
*dry, some locations become dry, some in fire, some "frostbited", some
*forbidden, etc. (as in location that we consider for previous game) Need to
*find N artifacts (there is N biomes) Part IV: bigger nature degradation, some
*extra locations(hidden), more location-specific weather, new creatures "not
*from our world" Need to kill/spare N bosses from each locations, banishing
*evil "from our lands" Part V: before final extra bosses, extra locations -
*dangeons (randomly generated) Part VI: end of the World, full collapse Part
*VII: realizing, who we are and that all was our imagination... (or not?)
